# Sulo's BetterDiscord Plugins
My plugins for [Betterdiscord](https://betterdiscord.app)

If it doesnt export, do it manually with your gifsaver.config.js file here: [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/bepvte/full/VwzVzpq).

CanaryLinks: When clicking "Copy Message Link" on Discord Canary or PTB, make links start with https://discord.com/channels/ instead of https://canary.discord.com/channels/

NoSpotifyPause: Prevents Discord from pausing your Spotify when streaming or gaming

StereoSound: Used to provide stereo audio input, is now broken. I also deleted it so people stop asking about it.
