# Sulo's BetterDiscord Plugins
My plugins for BetterDiscord

GifSaver: GifSaver is sunset, as the feature is built into discord now. Currently, the plugin exports your most recent gif backup to a file for you, since the new discord gif store is limited to 250 gifs.

If it doesnt export, do it manually with your gifsaver.config.js file here: https://codepen.io/bepvte/full/VwzVzpq.

CanaryLinks: When clicking "Copy Message Link" on Discord Canary or PTB, make links start with https://discord.com/channels/ instead of https://canary.discord.com/channels/

NoSpotifyPause: Prevents Discord from pausing your Spotify when streaming or gaming

StereoSound: Used to provide stereo audio input, is now broken. I also deleted it so people stop asking about it.
